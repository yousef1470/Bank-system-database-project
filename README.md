### Bank System Database-project
## Overview
The Banking System Project develops a comprehensive database system using C# to manage multiple banks, Bank branches, and customer-related information. It provides a robust framework for banking operations such as customer account management, loan processing, and user administration.
## Proposed Functionalities
User Administration: The system enables signing up new users, including customers and employees. Administrators can add new banks and branches, while employees can register new customers at specific branches.
Data Retrieval: The system offers views of various loan types (such as industrial, commercial, and personal loans), and a list of customers.
Loan Operations: Customers can request and start loan operations through the system. Employees can manage loan applications by accepting, rejecting, or processing loan payments.
## Technologies Used 
Database Management: The system employs database technologies to store and manage structured data for banks, branches, customers, accounts, and loans.
